        <h1>About Dubai</h1>
        <p>Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes 
            place alongside sun-seeking tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, 
            it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the atmosphere is generally 
            tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life. 
            Islam is the majority religion, but churches 
            and Hindu temples coexist with Dubaiâ€™s mosques </p>
